## Origin of this mod
This mod comes from https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/1191 from NexusMods so all rights belong to the original author.

## Why this repo exists?
This repo exists as some of the comments that exist on the mod's page haven't been implemented by the author and I had to follow the community's instructions to do them.

I am now sharing a working version for my resolution so it may also work for you.
